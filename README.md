# Problem 6

From [JaamSim Pro Guide Lesson 7](https://hypercubescientific.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HYP/pages/15859744/7.+Sample+problem+6+-+build+an+integrated+model+from+scratch)

A basic mine and port system, connected by a single line with sidings.

## Problems

- ~~Single material system:~~
  - ~~Only when there is flow into the Stock-pile does the stock-pile also unload into the ship~~
  - ~~Split the port MFS into two, one for the slow into the Stockpile and another from the Stockpile~~
- Trains block the main line while the TUL is busy unloading
  - Add a holding link so that the main line is clear
